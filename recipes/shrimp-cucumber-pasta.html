    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is another one of those "I can wake up next morning and start cooking" ready kind of kids lunch ideas. Except I do need to put out the frozen shrimps the night before</p>


    <p>Ingredients: 
        <ul>
            <li>Shrimp</li>
            <li>Spaghetti</li>
            <li>cucumber</li>
            <li>Sea Salt</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>Ginger</li>
        </ul> 



    </p>

    <p>Steps: 
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the spaghetti first, drain, abd put aside</li>
            <li>Heat pan, put in oil</li>            
            <li>slice some ginger, put them in first the test the oil tempreture</li>   
            <li>Chop the shrimp and dice the cucumber to the size of your liking</li>         
            <li>Chop the shrimp into smaller bites to your liking, and put in the pan</li>            
            <li>After the shrimps all turned red, put in the cucumber. Remeber now, the shrimp has not been fully cooked yet, but by the time the cucumber is tender, they will be ready.</li>            
            <li>Mix well, add salt to your liking, and them put in the spagheddi</li>            
            <li>I would like to put in more oil enough to coat all the noodle, shrimp, and cucumber. This is why healthy oil is to be used. <STROng><EM>TRY AVOIDING SEED OIL!</EM></STROng></li>
            <li>Taste it, and you can also add more salt.</li>
        </ol> 



    </p>
    <p>Yes yes you can use more fancy flavors like crushed red peper, diced garlic, oyster sauce; the key is simplicity</p>
