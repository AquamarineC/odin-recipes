    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Again, the idea is the simple the better, the less ingredient the better. This is lunch for kids, but can also stand alone as a formal dinner dish.</p>


    <p>Ingredients: </p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ground meat (We only use ground beef for personal preference.)</li>
            <li>A bag of carrot(3 lb bag)</li>
            <li>Sea salt</li>
            <li>Oil. A recommendation only: <strong><em>DO NOT CONSUME SEED OIL!!!</em></strong></li>
            <li>Cooking wine if cannot stand the smell from the ground meat</li>
            <li>Rice of course. Plain rice</li>
        </ul> 

    </p>
 
    <p>Steps: </p>
<p>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash, pill, and grate the carrot into small dices. This is really the most hardworking part of the dish, unless you also ground your own meat.</li>            
            <li>Heat the pan, put in quite a bit of oil</li>
            <li>After oil is heated, dump in the ground meat, break it apart and cook it. Add the cooking wine if you need to</li>
            <li>Add salt to the meat to your liking, then dump in the carrot.(No need to flip dishes back and forth, in and out. Ready in one go)</li>
            <li>Keeps stiring until mixed and carrot coated with oil for about 2 min, then add hot water to cover the evenly distributed dish</li>
            <li>Let it cook for some time, because it is ready when the extra water evaporate. By now, everything is fully cooked and carrot is tender and juicy</li>
        </ol> 



    </p>
   

    <p>I like to cook big portion for it makes a wonderful leftover.</p>
