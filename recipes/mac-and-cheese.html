    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>After many trials and errors, I reached a decent balance of <strong>the most simple to make</strong> and my daughters are both <strong>loving it</strong>.</p>
    <p>This is my homemade Mac and Cheese. Nothing fancy, but easy to make, easy to measure, and easy to standardize</p>


    <p>Ingredients: 
        <ul>
            <li>Macaroni <em>Of course lol</em></li>
            <li>Cheese (Yes I tried many kinds, but ended up using Medium Cheddar exclusively.)</li>
            <li>Homo Milk</li>
            <li>Salted butter: It adds flavour, but the main purpose is the thicken the milk</li>
            <li>Sea salt</li>

        </ul> 



    </p>

    <p>Steps: 
        <ol>
            <li>Grate the cheese. I know it is lots of work, but I see it as necessary because we can then melt the cheese properly in the pan</li>            
            <li>Boil the noodles, drain, and set aside</li>
            <li>Using the same empty boiling pan, add milk, dump all the grated cheese inside and the keep the heat low</li>
            <li>Now see the cheese melt in the milk. Add butter accordingly to thicken the sause. <em>or add back more milk otherwise.</em> Very resilient to mistakes, so that one can hardly screw up</li>
            <li>Add salt to your liking, and dump the macaroni in.</li>
            <li>Keep stiring until macaroni is all coated with thick cheese sause</li>
            <li>Taste it, because you can still add salt at this stage. Again, hard to screw up</li>

        </ol> 



    </p>
    <p>Not the fanciest Mac and Cheese dish, but simple and easy. I use a whole back of a Macaroni and a whole package of cheese, so I also do not have to measure. Easy to stock and inventory. Used the least amount of supply and get it up and running on moments notice</p>
